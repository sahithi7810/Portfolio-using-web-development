# Portfolio-using-web-development
Portfolio web development involves creating a personal or professional website to showcase skills, projects, experience, and achievements. A portfolio website acts as an online resume, allowing potential clients, employers, or collaborators to see examples of past work, understand your expertise, and learn more about your background.

Key elements often include a homepage with an introduction, a portfolio or projects section, an "About Me" page, and contact information. Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks (such as React or Bootstrap) are commonly used to build portfolios. A well-designed portfolio site can be a powerful tool for freelancers, creatives, and professionals to establish an online presence and attract opportunities.
